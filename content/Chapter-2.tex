\section{Hamiltonian}

This is a Hamiltonian for an even-even triaxial nucleus:
\begin{align}
    \hat{H}=\hat{H}_\text{core}+\epsilon
\end{align}

The above Hamiltonian was studied in \cite{frauendorf1997tilted,raduta2006description,raduta2016new,poenaru2021parity}.

\section{Wave-function}

The wave-function of the system must be rotationally invariant. The charge distribution in the nucleus is strictly related to the quadrupole effects generated by the nucleons moving in a mean-field.
