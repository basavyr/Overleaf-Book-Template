\section{Hamiltonian 2}

This is a Hamiltonian for an even-even triaxial nucleus:
\begin{align}
    \hat{H}=\hat{H}_\text{core}+\epsilon
\end{align}

\section{Wave-function}

The wave-function of the system must be rotationally invariant. The charge distribution in the nucleus is strictly related to the quadrupole effects generated by the nucleons moving in a mean-field.
