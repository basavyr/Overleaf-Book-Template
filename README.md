# Overleaf Book Template [CI/CD]

## A CI/CD pipeline for a `Latex` based code project

This repository contains a Latex project for a book template. The code-base is integrated with Azure Pipelines. 

Deployment on GitHub + Azure Pipelines ðŸš€

With each progress on the book's structure, the CI/CD process will produce an automated pipeline which compiles the developed `.tex` file(s), and finally, generating the resulting `.pdf` file as a *build artifact*.

Artifact will be available for download ðŸ“„ .
